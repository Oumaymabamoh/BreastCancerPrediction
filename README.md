# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an interpretable machine learning model for predicting breast cancer malignancy. Leveraging a dataset rich in cell nuclei characteristics, we aim to create a model that not only achieves high accuracy but also provides insights into the decision-making process.

## Project Structure
The project is organized following the CRISP-DM methodology. Key folders include:
- `data`: Contains the dataset (`data.csv`) and any additional data-related files.
- `notebooks`: Includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and analysis.
- `src`: Consists of source code, such as Python scripts, for model training, evaluation, and GUI development.

## Data
The dataset (`data.csv`) comprises various features related to cell nuclei characteristics. Explore the dataset to understand the input variables and target labels.

## Modeling
The `src/modeling.ipynb` notebook showcases the process of model development. We experimented with different algorithms, prioritizing accuracy and interpretability. Cross-validation results and model evaluations are presented.

## GUI
To enhance usability, a graphical user interface (GUI) is proposed for easy interaction with the predictive model.
